A simple day planner with empty fields for adding your own notes or scehduling for the day. Your notes can be saved by clicking the save buttons on the end of the columns.
Found this project relatively difficult even with most of the bones provided, could not solve coloring the blocks based on time. I know I'm close though, I just need to get more proficient at writing successfull functions and loops.


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
